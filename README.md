# Practical Startpage
Chrome Extension that replaces the default newtab. Install from [Practical Startpage in chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ikjalccfdoghanieehppljppanjlmkcf)

## About
Startpage focused on practical features rather then flashy look.

Practical Startpage is for those that want a functional startpage, allowing easy access to chrome data, such as bookmarks and history.

## Contributions
Right now the code is in TFS, but will be moved here shortly. There is some work needed on the widget/plugin system to allow other to easily create plugins.

Instructions on structure and coding rules will come as well.
